#### Problem Set 0
Download and install the latest version of Chrome, if you don’t have it already.
Implement your very own Scratch project using Chrome, per this specification.

#### Scratch Specification
- Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
- Your project must use at least one sound.
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Ivy’s Hardest Game. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.

Once finished with your project, select File > Save now one last time. Then select File > Save to your computer and keep that file so that you can submit it.
